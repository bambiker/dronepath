# FLYTIMIZER

### Drone Optimal Route & Altitude Optimizer

**FLYTIMIZER** helps drone operators find a more efficient flight profile between two locations by considering wind, altitude, drone performance, payload, and environmental constraints.

## What is FLYTIMIZER?

Wind conditions can change significantly with altitude. A route that looks optimal near the ground may not be the fastest or most efficient route at a different height.

FLYTIMIZER evaluates different flight altitudes and estimates the time required for the outbound and return legs of a drone flight.

Instead of simply flying at a fixed altitude, FLYTIMIZER asks:

> **What altitude should the drone fly at to complete the mission as efficiently as possible?**

## Current Features

* 📍 Select a **start point and destination** directly on the map
* 🌬️ Retrieve wind conditions at different altitudes
* 🚁 Select a drone model or define custom drone parameters
* 📦 Account for different payload conditions on outbound and return flights
* ⬆️ Consider ascent and descent time
* 💨 Account for wind resistance and drag
* 🏫 Identify schools, kindergartens, hospitals and playgrounds   
* 🏢 Maintain a configurable clearance above mapped buildings
* 🌧️ Display additional weather information such as:

  * Rain probability
  * Precipitation
  * Visibility
* 🔄 Optimize the outbound and return flight heights independently
* 📊 Compare estimated flight performance at multiple altitudes

---

## How It Works

The user selects two points on the map:

**Start → Destination**

FLYTIMIZER then evaluates several candidate altitudes between **20 m and 120 m**.

For each altitude, the system considers factors including:

* Wind speed
* Wind direction
* Flight heading
* Drone horizontal speed
* Ascent speed
* Descent speed
* Wind resistance
* Drag coefficient
* Payload coefficient
* Flight distance

The system estimates the flight time for each candidate altitude and identifies the altitude with the lowest estimated flight time.

The return leg can be evaluated separately because the wind direction relative to the drone's heading is reversed.

---

## Why Altitude Matters

Wind is not necessarily the same at every altitude.

A drone may encounter:

* Lower wind speeds near the ground
* Stronger winds higher up
* Different wind directions with altitude
* Favorable tailwinds at one altitude
* Stronger headwinds at another altitude

Therefore, the shortest geometric route is not necessarily the fastest route.

For longer flights, higher-drag aircraft, or significant winds along the flight direction, altitude selection can have a measurable effect on flight time and potentially on energy consumption.

## Drone Parameters

FLYTIMIZER currently supports configurable parameters such as:

| Parameter           | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Horizontal speed    | Nominal horizontal flight speed                 |
| Ascent speed        | Vertical climb speed                            |
| Descent speed       | Vertical descent speed                          |
| Wind resistance     | Maximum wind condition considered for the drone |
| Drag coefficient    | Aerodynamic drag parameter                      |
| Payload coefficient | Relative payload effect on flight performance   |

Drone presets can be used where available, while individual parameters can also be modified.

## Payload

Payload can affect flight performance.

FLYTIMIZER allows different payload coefficients for:

* **Outbound flight**
* **Return flight**

This is useful for missions such as deliveries where the drone carries a payload on the outbound leg but returns empty.

For example:

```text
Outbound:
Drone + payload

Return:
Drone only
```

This allows the two legs of the mission to be evaluated independently.

---

## Environmental Constraints

The map incorporates selected features from OpenStreetMap.

Currently, FLYTIMIZER identifies locations such as:

* Schools
* Kindergartens
* Hospitals
* Playgrounds

These areas are displayed on the map and considered when generating the route.

Mapped buildings are also used to maintain a minimum clearance above structures.

> The current implementation is an optimization and planning tool, not a replacement for official aviation regulations, NOTAMs, airspace restrictions, or operator responsibility.

---

## Weather Data

Current wind and weather information is obtained from **Open-Meteo**.

The application uses weather information at multiple altitudes to evaluate how the atmospheric conditions may affect the flight.

Weather forecasts are inherently uncertain, so calculated results should be treated as estimates rather than guaranteed flight conditions.

---

## Research Background

Several aspects of the current model are based on published research and engineering references, including:

* Effects of payload and aircraft weight on flight performance
* Wind variation with altitude
* Drone aerodynamic drag
* Atmospheric boundary-layer wind behavior
* Effects of drone altitude on acoustic disturbance

Relevant references are provided directly in the application.

---

## Current Limitations

FLYTIMIZER is an evolving prototype.

The current version does **not** attempt to model every factor affecting a real drone mission.

Examples include:

* Detailed battery state-of-charge modeling
* Battery aging
* Temperature-dependent battery performance
* Detailed motor/propeller efficiency
* Turbulence
* Building-induced local wind fields
* Complete 3D CFD wind modeling
* Dynamic obstacles
* Air traffic
* Real-time airspace restrictions
* Complete regulatory compliance checking
* Detailed energy consumption along every segment

The current optimization should therefore be considered a **decision-support estimate**, rather than an autonomous flight command.

---

## Roadmap

Potential future development includes:

### Building-Scale Wind

Future versions may incorporate local wind effects around buildings, terrain and urban structures.

This could allow the optimizer to distinguish between:

* Open terrain
* Urban areas
* Wind corridors
* Wind shadows
* Exposed rooftops
* Sheltered areas

### Energy Optimization

Instead of optimizing only estimated flight time, future versions could estimate:

```text
Battery consumption
        ↓
Energy cost
        ↓
Remaining battery
        ↓
Safe return margin
```

### Flight Log Learning

Real flight data could eventually be used to compare:

```text
Forecast wind
      vs.
Observed wind
      vs.
Actual drone performance
```

This could allow FLYTIMIZER to learn aircraft-specific performance and local wind biases over time.

## Project Status

🚧 **Early-stage prototype / research project**

The goal is to develop FLYTIMIZER into a practical platform for wind-aware drone flight planning and optimization.

The current web application is primarily a demonstration and experimentation environment.

---

## Disclaimer

FLYTIMIZER provides estimated flight-planning information.

It does not provide legal authorization to operate a drone and does not replace applicable aviation regulations, airspace information, weather warnings, operational risk assessments, or the judgment of a qualified drone operator.

Always verify current regulations, airspace restrictions and actual weather conditions before flight.
